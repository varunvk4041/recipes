    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This butter chicken recipe, or chicken makhani, is one of my favorite Indian dishes.</p> 
    <p>It features a full-flavored sauce that complements the chicken well.</p>
    <p>It can be made as mild or spicy as you wish by adjusting the cayenne.</p>
    <p>Serve with basmati rice and naan bread.</p>
